# Your task

Your task is to complete the `readability.py` program so that it calculates the approximate grade level required to understand some text. You should use the `get_string` function from the `helpers.py` file to prompt the user for a string of text (using `input`). Then, you should print the grade level using the `print` function after calculating it using the Coleman-Liau formula.

## Sample usage

```bash
$ python3 readability.py
Text: Congratulations! Today is your day. You're off to Great Places! You're off and away!
Grade 3
```

```bash
$ python3 readability.py
Text: Maybe it's not the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe.
Grade 6
```
